# Ignite Maps Plugin

This plugin adds [react-native-maps](https://github.com/airbnb/react-native-maps)
to your [Ignite](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite) React Native project and
configures it so it works out of the box with Ignite projects. It also includes
a couple generators to help you quickly add map components.

## Usage

```
$ ignite add maps
$ ignite generate map StoreLocator
```

This adds `ignite-maps` and generates a component at `./App/Components/StoreLocator.js`.
