# Ignite Maps Plugin

This plugin adds [react-native-maps](https://github.com/airbnb/react-native-maps)
to your [Ignite](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite) React Native project and
configures it so it works out of the box.

So why not just install it yourself? Unfortunately, `react-native-maps` doesn't
quite work out of the box. There are a few issues we've run into at
[Infinite Red](https://infinite.red) and this Ignite plugin helps speed you
along your way.

## Usage

```
$ ignite add maps
$ ignite generate map StoreLocator
```

This generates a component at `./App/Components/StoreLocator.js`.
